						Anti-tank drones, also known as loitering munitions or
						kamikaze drones, are unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
						specifically designed to target and destroy enemy tanks
						or armored vehicles. These drones are equipped with
						explosive payloads and are capable of precision strikes
						against ground targets. They are often used in military
						operations for reconnaissance, surveillance, and
						tactical strikes. Anti-tank drones typically have the
						ability to loiter in the air for an extended period,
						allowing operators to identify and engage targets
						effectively. They can be remotely controlled or operate
						autonomously with pre-programmed instructions.

					<p>
						Surveillance drones, also known as reconnaissance or
						UAVs, are unmanned aircraft used for monitoring and
						collecting information. These drones are equipped with
						cameras, sensors, and other technologies to capture
						images, videos, and data from the air. Surveillance
						drones have a wide range of applications, including
						military reconnaissance, border patrol, disaster
						response, agriculture, and law enforcement. The primary
						purpose of surveillance drones is to provide real-time
						or near-real-time information from aerial perspectives,
						enhancing situational awareness and decision-making.
						These drones are often used for monitoring large areas,
						tracking movements, and gathering intelligence without
						putting human operators at risk.
